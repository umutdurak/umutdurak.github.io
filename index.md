This is the home page of Umut Durak. I am a research scientist at the [Institute of Flight Systems](https://dlr.de/ft){:target="_blank"}
of the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://dlr.de){:target="_blank"}, professor at the at the 
[Institute of Informatics](https://ifi.tu-clausthal.de){:target="_blank"} of the [Clausthal University of Technology (TU Clausthal)](https://www.tu-clausthal.de){:target="_blank"}. I am a jazz listener, an occasional cycler, a seldom photographer, a constant reader, an hardly speaker, a mediacore listener, a bad mandoline and guitar player, a good husband and the best father ever:) 

### Academic Life

I have long been involved in aeronautical informatics, the interdisciplinary domain of computer science and aeronautical engineering. 
My recent research interests lie generally in engineering of safety critical software intensive airborne systems. 
My backgrround is modeling and simulation, and simulation engineering. I worked a long time on modeling and simulation based engineering of airborne systems. At the DLR, I have a research group on assured embedded systems, better said safety critical avionics systems.
At the same time, I coordinate the collaborative research group on
[Aeronautical Informatics](https://www.ifi.tu-clausthal.de/abteilungen/big-data-and-technical-information-systems-bdis/aeronautical-informatics){:target="_blank"} at the TU Clausthal. I offer two course, the Simulation Engineering in winter semesters, and the Aeronautical
Informatics at the summer semesters. I also supervise master and PhD theses. 

You can find the list of my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=JgyukpMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}. We also have a Github Organization for [Aeronautical Informatics](https://github.com/aeronautical-informatics){:target="_blank"} where you can see some of our open sourced work. My professional profile is well presented at my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umutdurak/){:target="_blank"}. I also do a bit of [twittering](https://twitter.com/udurak){:target="_blank"} and [instagraming](https://www.instagram.com/wojakzek/){:target="_blank"}. 

### Real Life

Is the academic one not real? It is also real, but I believe not real real. What ever it means :) Here I would like to give links to my blogs that has a glimpse of what I do daily, better said what I did. 
[Umut'un Günlügü](http://umutungunlugu.blogspot.com){:target="_blank"} is the blogger archive of my blog that I wrote between 2005 and 2016. That one is in Turkish. The next one is [Umut'in Fotograf Sergisi](http://umutunfotografsergisi.blogspot.com){:target="_blank"}; that is the fotoblog before the Instagram times. Still there for anyone who would like to browse my early work. Just a remark there, there is no later one. The last to mention is the [blog.umutdurak.de](http://blog.umutdurak.de){:target="_blank"} that will soon come to life, where I would like post about the "real life" in English.
