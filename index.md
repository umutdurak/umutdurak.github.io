## Welcome to my Homepage

This the home page of Umut Durak. I am a research scientist at the Institute of Flight Systems
of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), professor at the at the Institute of Informatics (Computer Science in international means) of
the Clausthal Universty of Technology (TU Clausthal). I am ajazz listener, an occasional cycler, a constant reader, an hardly speaker,
a mediacore listener, a bad mandoline and guitar player, a good husband and the best father ever:) 

### Academic Life

I have long been involeved in aeronautical informatics, the development and utilization of computer science and engineering for
aircrraft. My recent research interests go in the direction of engineering safety critical software intensive airborne systems. 
My backgrround is modeling and simulation, and simulation engineering. I worked a long time on modeling and simulation based engineering of airborne systems. At the DLR, I have a research group on assured embedded systems, better said safety critical avionics systems.
At the same time, at the TU Clausthal I also coordinate the collaborative research group on
aeronautical informatics. I offer two course, the Simulation Engineering in winter semesters, and the Aeronautical
Informatics at the summer semesters. I also supervise master and PhD theses.
